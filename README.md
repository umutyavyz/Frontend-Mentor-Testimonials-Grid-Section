# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials Grid Section

This is my solution to the [Testimonials Grid Section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).  
It was built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The goal was to create a responsive testimonials grid layout that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
